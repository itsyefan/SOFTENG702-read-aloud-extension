                Read Aloud is a Text to Speech Voice Reader extension for your browser! It is a simple and easy to use extension that can be used to read aloud any selected text on a webpage. It can also be used to read aloud the entire webpage. It is a great tool for
                people with visual impairments or for people who want to listen to the text instead of reading it.
                <br />
                <br /> Read Aloud is aimed at users who prefer to listen to content instead of reading, people with dyslexia or other learning disabilities, children learning to read, or simply to provide users with alternative way to consume web content.

            <p>
                Read Aloud allows you to select from a variety of text-to-speech voices, including those provided natively by the browser, as well as by text-to-speech cloud service providers such as Google Wavenet, Amazon Polly, IBM Watson, and Microsoft. Some of the
                cloud-based voices may require additional in-app purchase to enable.
                <br />
